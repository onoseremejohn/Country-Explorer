## My Process

### Built with

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- REST APIs
- React
- React Router
- Styled Components
- Axios
- Local Storage

### What I learned

- I gained experience in handling errors that can occur when working with APIs, specifically when dealing with missing or undefined properties in the response data. I checked for property definitions before using them to create more robust and reliable code.
- I also learned about global state management, which allowed me to efficiently manage and share data between different components of the project.
- I was able to expand my knowledge of web development by learning and applying advanced CSS techniques to create more responsive and dynamic user interfaces for the project.

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = ({ borders }) => {
  const borderCountries = allCountries.filter((country) =>
    country.codes.some((code) => borders.includes(code))
  );
};
```
